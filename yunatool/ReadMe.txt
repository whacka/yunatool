    CONSOLE APPLICATION : YUNATOOL Project Overview
========================================================================

	This is a program designed to extract the text from the PC Engine 
	Super CD-ROM2 game "Ginga Densetsu Ojousama Yuna".
	The file Track02.iso should be dropped onto the .exe (first 
	argument) and the options 1 through 4 progressivly extract and
	reinsert the game's script.
	By default scripts are extracted to "E:\YUNA\" and this may be 
	edited in the definitions.
	Editing should be done between options 2 and 3, option 2 must
	be run again after option 3 before editing the .txt files.
	Text must be editied in full-width SJIS including any full width 
	spaces, '/' indicates a new line (carriage return).
	Currently only supports the first game, but support for all 3 games
	is planned.
